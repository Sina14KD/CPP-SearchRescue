# Muitple UAVs Coverage Path Planning for Search and Rescue
This file includes the Python code for the NOPP algorithm proposed in the paper "An exact coverage path planning algorithm for UAV-based search
and rescue operations" (Demo is available at http://sina14.pythonanywhere.com/). Also, by downloading the file "Demo_Video.mp4", you can see the generated solution of the NOPP algorithm for 20 UAVs in a 73x59 search area as a video.

How to run the file:

1- Install Matplotlib and Numpy

2- Run the nopp_algorithm.py

Example: 

n=15 (number of cells along the length of the rectangular area)

m=15 (number of cells along the width of the rectangular area)

q=4 (number of UAVs(drones))

The solution was generated by the NOPP algorithm (Solution contains 4 lists in which the first list is the path for the first drone and the second list is for the second drone and so on):
